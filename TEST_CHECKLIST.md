# jt-ipam Release Test Checklist

> zh-TW version: [TEST_CHECKLIST_zh-TW.md](TEST_CHECKLIST_zh-TW.md).

> Rule: **before bumping the `version` in `frontend/package.json`, run this whole
> checklist once; only release when everything is green.**
> Treat it as the manual gate. Fix the red ones first — do not ship sick.

Release flow: run the checklist → all green → bump version → deploy
(backend rsync + alembic + restart; frontend build).

---

## 1. Static checks (dev box, no DB, fastest)

- [ ] Backend imports: `cd backend && set -a; source <env>; set +a; .venv/bin/python -c "import app.main"`
- [ ] Backend pytest collection has no error (DB tests skip): `.venv/bin/pytest -q`
- [ ] Frontend types: `cd frontend && npx vue-tsc --noEmit` (must be zero errors)
- [ ] Frontend build: `npm run build` (dist produced successfully)
- [ ] i18n: every new key exists in both `zh-TW.json` and `en-US.json`; no hard-coded
  Chinese slipped through

## 2. Database / migration (use a throwaway test DB, never touch prod data)

- [ ] A fresh DB upgrades from 0001 to head cleanly: run `alembic upgrade head`
  against `jt_ipam_test`
- [ ] Each new migration has a `downgrade()` and survives one
  `alembic downgrade -1` then `upgrade head` round-trip
- [ ] No "model changed but migration forgotten": after upgrading to head the app
  starts without an asyncpg "column does not exist" error

## 3. Backend integration tests (test DB + pytest, thorough)

- [ ] With `JTIPAM_TEST_DATABASE_URL` set, `.venv/bin/pytest -q` is all green
  (e2e CRUD / auth / each module)
- [ ] Auth: login, refresh, TOTP, permissions (unauthorized `require_admin`
  endpoints return 401/403)
- [ ] Core CRUD: sections / subnets / addresses / devices / customers / locations / racks
- [ ] Audit chain: write operations are audited and chain integrity verifies

## 4. Key API smoke (against prod after deploy, mostly read-only)

- [ ] `GET /api/v1/health` (or `/notifications`) returns 200
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/subnets`, `/addresses`, `/devices`, `/locations`, `/racks` return 200
- [ ] Endpoints touched this release: manually hit one success path + one failure
  path (verify the 4xx is correct)

## 5. OWASP Top 10:2025 self-review (modules touched this release)

- [ ] A01 authorization: do new endpoints correctly use `require_admin` /
  object-level authorization?
- [ ] A03 injection / input validation: Pydantic StrictModel; file uploads verify
  magic bytes + size limit + reject dangerous types (e.g. SVG)
- [ ] A08 integrity: uploads / external data are validated; no path traversal
  (resolved upload/download paths stay inside the allow-listed directory)
- [ ] Secrets: no secret/token written to logs or responses

## 5b. Deploy-script flows (throwaway environment, **never run install on dev/prod**)

- [ ] **Fresh install**: on a clean LXC/VM run `scripts/install-debian.sh`; the
  service comes up and you can log in
- [ ] **Upgrade**: against a previous-version environment run
  `scripts/jt-ipam-upgrade.sh`; it upgrades cleanly and can roll back if needed
- [ ] If this release added a directory / package / service / DB extension / env,
  confirm **both scripts are in sync**

## 5c. Headless browser smoke

- [ ] `cd frontend && pnpm exec playwright test smoke` (no backend; self-starts
  vite preview) all green
- [ ] Against a deployed instance (with `E2E_BASE_URL` + `E2E_ADMIN_PASS`) run
  `pnpm test:e2e` main paths (login / sections / audit)

## 6. Manual page review (browser, after deploy)

- [ ] Login / logout / theme switch (light / dark / auto)
- [ ] Subnets: list, tree, IP list (incl. idle-range rows spanning columns), edit
- [ ] Devices / racks: sorting (natural IP order), consistent action-button height,
  floor-plan upload + drag-to-place + select
- [ ] Topology: nodes / links, VPN pairing links, legend
- [ ] Scan agents / sync jobs: pages render, no console errors

### Appendix: throwaway test DB commands (on the prod host, **never the prod DB**)

```bash
set -a; source /etc/jt-ipam/backend.env; set +a
sudo -u postgres psql -c "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS jt_ipam_test;"
sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE DATABASE jt_ipam_test OWNER ${POSTGRES_USER} ENCODING UTF8 TEMPLATE template0;"
sudo -u postgres psql -d jt_ipam_test -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector; CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;"
cd /opt/jt-ipam/backend
POSTGRES_DB=jt_ipam_test .venv/bin/alembic upgrade head
JTIPAM_TEST_DATABASE_URL="postgresql+asyncpg://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@${POSTGRES_HOST}:${POSTGRES_PORT}/jt_ipam_test" .venv/bin/pytest -q
sudo -u postgres psql -c "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS jt_ipam_test;"
```
